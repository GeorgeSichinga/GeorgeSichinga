👋 Hi, I’m George. I specialize in Environment and Climate Change Modeling, with a strong grounding in data science and economics.

📊 My work focuses on applying data driven and computational methods to analyze environmental systems, climate variability, and their socioeconomic impacts, particularly in agriculture and development contexts.

🌱 I am currently advancing my skills in big data analytics using the Hadoop and Apache ecosystem, advanced database management with SQL and NoSQL, and full stack application development using Node.js and Next.js.

🔍 My interests include climate data analysis, environmental modeling, and impact evaluation, with an emphasis on translating complex data into insights that support policy, resilience, and sustainable development.

💞️ I am open to collaborating on projects related to climate change modeling, environmental data science, agricultural economics, and open source tools for climate and social impact.
